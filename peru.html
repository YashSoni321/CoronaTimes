          The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have reached the United
          States in January 2020. The first confirmed case of local transmission
          was recorded in January,[8] while the first known deaths happened in
          February.[9] By the end of March, cases had occurred in all 50 U.S.
          states, the District of Columbia, and all inhabited U.S. territories
          except American Samoa.[10][11] As of May 27, 2020, the U.S. had the
          most confirmed active cases and deaths in the world,[12][13] and its
          death rate was 285 per million people, the ninth-highest rate
          globally.[14][15] The Trump administration declared a public health
          emergency on January 31, then on February 2 began to prevent the entry
          of mostresident Donald Trump was optimistic and "cheer-leading the
          country",[24][25] downplaying the threat posed by the coronavirus and
          claiming that the outbreak was under control.[26] On February 25, the
          Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned the American
          public for
          <img src="uspic.jpg" alt="" class="responsive" />
          the first time to prepare for a local outbreak.[27] A national
          emergency was declared by President Trump on March 13.[28] In early
          March, the Food and Drug Administration began allowing public health
          agencies and private companies to develop and administer tests, and
          loosened restrictions so that anyone with a doctor's order could be
          tested.[22] By the end of the month, over 1 million people had been
          tested (1 per 320 inhabitants).[29][30] The Trump administration
          largely waited until mid-March to start purchasing large quantities of
          medical equipment.[31] In late March, the administration started to
          use the Defense Production Act to direct industries to produce medical
          equipment.[32] Federal health inspectors who surveyed hospitals in
          late March found shortages of test supplies, personal protective
          equipment (PPE), and other resources due to extended patient stays
          while awaiting test results.[33] By early May, the U.S. had processed
          around 6.5 million tests (about 1 per 50 inhabitants),[30][34] and was
          conducting around 250,000 tests per day, but experts said this level
